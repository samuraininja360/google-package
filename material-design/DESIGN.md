### Material Design

Make sure to follow the rules of appealing design by using Material components wisely. Make sure to even out the attention to components and choose suitable colour combinations.
Although art is about creativity, good design requires critical thinking of how to correctly adjust size and position to build a pleasing UI. Do not fill every corner of your 
page with bright colours; make sure to switch between neutral colours that are easy on the eyes. 

## Font

I recommend using Leon Sans or Aviex (can be downloaded at my Aviex repo) becasue Robotto just looks bland and degrades your minimalistic design, but there are also other good fonts
like Montserrat and Poppins!
